## What About \_b00t_?
ElasticDotVentures \_b00t_ is 
a highly opinionated set of tools for deploying Azure cloud services with EV libraries (called "c0re", a subset of "c0de"), for Google 👾, Azure 🤖.  

The _b00t_ approach uses incorporates 1337 speak for c0mm0n words to encourage brevity at all layers. _b00t_'s design is built to tightly couple the Azure cloud, but integrate with others for services.  Creating multi-layer pipelines using a menu driven approach to generate templates and then execute those templates, download the projects, then build and rebuild. 

The 1337speak used in _b00t_ is primarily used to make unique pnemonics that are easier to grep during a subsystem trace across layers in the stack.  The naming models create colorful and meaningful filters to radically improve code quality & debuggability in some cases approaching a more "zero-code" approach and simultaneously gaining valuable screen real-estate. 

 1337 mechanics generally indicate logical role or purpose. Using tab-complete in Intellisense IDE and CLI makes it easy and artistic on the screen reinforcing art-in-code.  

Built to deploy Azure Logic Connectors & Azure Durable Functions with Python & Typescript Connectors, Azure Service Bus 🚌, Azure KeyVault💎 Configs⚙️, Azure ARM/Bicep 💪. Check Jargon.md for more the full glossary & naming conventions.  

Docker 🐳, Python 🐍, TypeScript 🦄 - emoji indicates things like designee, consignee, etc.  This is an important aspect of the "storytell" logging.  StoryTell creates really colorful transaction logs & error dumps.  These patterns help our soon-to-be-obsolete primate brains abstract patterns that wouldn't be nearly as obvious in regular English text.

# Example (in code)
_b00t_ is bi-lingual, one of the c0des it understands is bash script. 
Here's a sample Bash function taken from the c0re to see if a machine is running Windows System for Linux version 2, abbreviated to WSLv2. The Emoji colorfully demonstrates this bi-lingual principle: 
```bash

### - -   is_WSLv2_🐧💙🪟v2   - - \\
## Microsoft Windows Linux Subsystem II 
## 🤓 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
#
function is_WSLv2_🐧💙🪟v2() {
    return `cat /proc/version | grep -c "microsoft-standard-WSL2"`
}
### - -   is_WSLv2_🐧💙🪟v2   - - //

```

## And here's how to decode it:
* 🐧 Penguin .....  Linux (Tux, Mascot)
* 💙 Blue Heart ..  Microsoft:💙, Google:💚, AWS:🪙
* 🪟 Windows .....  self explanatory!

So: Without knowing what WSLv2 "is" using only three symbols you can infer a lot about it! 

This behavior becomes a mighty 🦸‍♀️_SUPERPOWER_🦸 when used with the new [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) Linux kernel features, discussed elsewhere. 


# ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is Alpha software. _b00t_ is Provided AS-IS! \_b00t_is rique NFSW, for example a default project could be auto-named "butt_plug" or something like that, it's intentionally cheeky and non-discriminatory.  _b00t_ contains a powerful build process that can muster substantial resources.  

# 🥋 Mixed-Martial-Art-Of-Coding: "StoryTime Logging"
\_b00t_ is designed around the idea of "StoryTime" logging that includes Emoji & HSK 1 Chinese Vocabulary - Please Don't be intimidated.  Default settings leave English translations on.  The Author (@BrianHorakh) is a native English speaker and multi-language polygot (Spanish, Mandarin, ~Italian, ~German, ~Portguese) all have their own linguistic style and strengths.  Think of this as mixed-martial-art-of-coding! 

# 🤯 为是吗TF is HSK1? 
HSK1 is Level 1 Chinese Mandarin language skill, in this case using simplified pinyin symbols. Simplified Pinyin is a screen glyph optimized font - that means HSK1 characters are very easy to read!  Presently emoji pictograms are second-class languages are both regionally-ambiguous i.e. "🍆💦" has a plurality of meanings but it is two easy to recognize symbols "eggplant water".  

Simplified Pinyin is a very pretty font, it's designed to be more legible than traditional chinese on electronic devices. Simplified Pinyin is useful in a LOT of places (such as Azure Resource Names) where Emoji is not presently allowed. 

 Chinese pictograms are essentially the "original" black & white Emoji. HSK1 contains roughly ~500 word-meanings in a single character position (screen real-estate).  When we talk about Good naming conventions -- i.e. logic-role, _b00t_ tries to use uniform fixed width sequences 1-4 characters to hint, so Emoji + Mandarin-Pinyin. 

If _b00t_ was restricted to ONLY the western English 36 characters (A-Z,0-9) that would results in ~1.6m possible combinations & meanings and probably a dozen abbreviated words at most, not descriptive at all!   Those same 4 character positions using 1024 Emojis (~1.9tn), plus 500 HSK1 mandarin characters (~62.5bn), in total 1560 characters (36+1024+500) results in 5.9 TRILLION possible "stories" encoded in only 4 characters that your brain needs to process! 

Wow, so 4 characters of _b00t_ can represent *5.9 TRILLION stories*! 🤯 With *DEFAULT* English mode, the system will append the English. Keyboard translations in Windows & VS Code Extensions are coming, templates for cutting and pasting are herein. 

In this format the majority of upper-primate brains will naturally try to decode the color & symbols FIRST. Hence, _b00t_ is quicker-than-you'd-think to learn it's not an issue since your brain will subconciously learn the 意 (Yì, English: "Meaning of") Chinese characters. 🪄😁! you're learning to read Chinese!  Chinese Mandarin represents 1.8 billion _native_ speaker/readers.  English also has roughly 1.8bn globally -- HOWEVER only 400m are native speakers so everybody else already speaks another language besides English first! Emoji is universal.  Filtering with fzf using Emoji and HSK1 Pinyin feels G0D LIK3! 

# 🤩 Wait, What does _b00t_ do? 
\_b00t_ is an *opinionated* pipeline orchestration system with integrated VS Code development environemnt, CI/CD Pipeline, base system which is suitable for deploying any cloud-scale state-less machine-learning project in frameworks such as Nvidia Cuda, PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc. as desired.  \_b00t_ provides the base idempotent templates for resources & public/private code-libraries written in Azure ARM/Bicep. 

The ultimate output is a fully operational cloud-resource group, sensibile file shares, key-vaults, monitoring, logging scaffold skeletons in TS & Python as well (the "c0re") which presents itself as an interactive filesytem/blob storage.  Python & Typescript bindings. I'll eventually add some higher level Vue templates and hardware IOT/Arduino & ESP32 templates as well. When they run, they create beatiful stories in your logs about transactions. 

One aspect \_b00t_ is that it can be hardened and subsequently removed (using docker dive) during the publish to live/production.

From the \_b00t_ perspective it's trying to produce a cloud-function (or container) which is a readonly NVM-e backed memory blob that is frozen until it is triggered (probably by an inbound HTTP Websocket or Filesystem E_POLL notification).  The published container can be stripped down to ONLY perform the task it is assigned, thus improving it's security posture by removing tools & configuration files from public facing images.  In the 

When this is combined with the fact that since AppConfig Stores & KeyVaults are used -- these are strongly typed first-order support  for example in Azure Logic Functions any secure tokens (such as passwords, or access keys) from a Vault are tagged and automatically filtered from logs as well, making compliance & user privacy easier! Extensive use of pipelines and messaging queues allow for tests and other large jobs to be run in parallel at cloud scale.  

# What is Cloud Scale?
Cloud Scale, with respect to \_b00t_ refers to highly parallelized jobs which can be executed simulatenously.  For example if you have 1,500 tests and each one takes avg 2 seconds to run, that's roughly 50 minutes to "finish" tests before you can even start a build to production.  A cloud scale approach would be to complete those tests in parallel on 1,500 servers thus only takes 2 seconds (or, actually as long as the longest test, which is often a timeout, so ~60 seconds) .. but the same pattern also works for deploying containerized neural-network layers using more optimized protocols such as Google ProtocolBuffers. 

# Why is it so Opionated? 
For example, _b00t_ believes that VS Code with it's intellisense, typescript & python, docker, azure, aws, gcp, and plurality of other useful extensions is the the one true editor.  The pattern works best when using remote containers, which is one of the 层 Layers it builds & configures. 

The \_b00t_ organizational pattern is formatted around an intentionally lean "svelte" Enterprise. Debugging is on by default, serverless/consumption plans are default.  It assumes a development posture and assumes VS Code as an integrated environment, thus prescribing a suggest list of IDE extensions. 

Ultimately it will include internal tooling sufficient to run a company through built on top of the _b00t_ template.

# What is Idempotence & Determinism? 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence
Idempotence (UK: /ˌɪdɛmˈpoʊtəns/,[1] US: /ˌaɪdəm-/)[2] is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. 


A deterministic algorithm is an algorithm which, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states.   

Using Azure Functions, and Azure Logic Apps for orchestrating actions which allows a _b00t_ stack to behave as a globally distributed finite-state machine.   This is the higest level of durability which can be assigned to a software platform and is suitable to running fail-safe systems such as nuclear reactors. The author explicitly disclaims any responsibility for circumstances occurring decide to use _b00t_ to run your own backyard reactor.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system


# What is so Opionated? 
0MG. _b00t_ tries very hard to be Templates and Tools ("TnT") but inevitably through the selection of those it's opinions on "best" approach. 

The organizational pattern is formatted around a cross-competency, "Don't make me think" (any more than I need to) so it assigns emojis to meanings.  

This allows for the system to implement "story tell" during logs, showing entire transactions as a series of pictograms (colorful markov chains). Here is a sample of the _projects_ layout opinion: 

```
/mnt/c0re/._b00t_./    # this is the current memory core for _b00t_.  It will contain keys, it could be ephemeral (such as one time use keys)
=======
\_b00t_ tries to use a "Don't make me think" (any more than I need to) colorful, pattern rich, highly-compressed output. 
This allows for the system to "story tell" inside logs often showing an entire transaction as a series of pictograms.
It's amazing how easy it is to spot the problem in a sequence like this: 😁😁😁🤬😁
The deterministic nature means it's often possible to go back to the beginning of a transaction and re-run it. 

Here is a sample of the _projects_ opinion: 

```
/mnt/c0re/._b00t_./    # this is the current memory core for \_b00t_.  It will contain keys, it could be ephemeral (such as one time use keys)
>>>>>>> aab636915cca39188f1d289453119a7136c4bf88
|- ./your_Project/..   # each project has it's own directory. A project will only mount it's directory though. 
A project can also delete data it no longer needs, but it is (for now) a good semi-durable hash.

# Config (durable or ephemeral)
/mnt/c0Re/
|- /._b00t_./
|- /project/  # your configs. 

# 🤓 NOTE:
#   improve security posture: make upper level filesystems
#   readonly and removing configs from lower levels using 
#   docker "dive"

/c0de/*                # namespace on localfilesystem is mostly hardcoded. rationale: low DIRENT seek times by being @ /rootFs. 
 |- ./01-start.sh      # 🍰 Start Here!! Run this ./01-start.sh

 |- ./docker.🐳/      # additional Docker build files, emoji coded 层 (Céng) Layers
 |- ./python.🐍/      # python stuff that will probably end up in _t00ls_
 |- ./node-ts.🦄/     # typescript libraries

 |- ./google.👾/      # google cloud (still fresh) 
 |- ./aws.🦉/         # aws cloud (nothing planned here, presently) 
 |- ./aws.🦉/         # aws cloud (nothing planned here, presently) 
```

By subscribing to this pattern, an effort is made to obviate certain things.  Layers are built upon layers. 
For example a deployed system can be wiped of Dockerfiles using:
```
rm -Rf ./Dockerfile ./docker.🐳
```
This is handy at later builds.  For example a GIT filesystem can be stripped of utilities that is no longer needed.  Once that is compressed at a Docker Buildx layer then that information has destroyed during the idempotent container creation.

_b00t_ assumes the author will (ultimately) decide to end up using a combination of stateful logic so it simplifies the interface to those by creating a unified command language that can be further build on.  There is a method to the madness, I assure you.  The patterns utilize serverless consumption plans whenever possible.  The plan is to eventually include complete VS code project files & plugin.    This assumes the developer(s) are using a three stage release model, "InnerLoop" (Local), "OuterLoop" (Cloud and/or Local), "Production" (Live) each of those moving the data to the cloud and toward the public, no attempts are made. 

# Why Emoji & HSK1 Chinese
I'm not gonna explain here, just read my Medium:

/c0de/_b00t_/ZZ-remove.sh        : clean up a project 
``


## Get Started: 
```bash
Someday I'll have this DEPLOY to AZURE working., for
Someday this DEPLOY to AZURE button will work as a scripted process. 

create a resource group:
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2F101-storage-account-create%2Fazuredeploy.json)

For now:

export resourceGroup="newProject"
export region="useast"

mkdir -p /c0de && cd /c0de
git clone git@github.com:elasticdotventures/_b00t_.git
cd ./_b00t_/ && ./01-start.sh

that will start running the soon-to-be interactive installer. 
```

Then, once you've setup _b00t_ you can start to create your own projects. 
```
# to start a new project: 
/c0de/_b00t_/up new ~ 

# or: 
my_project_id="<YOUR PROJECT>"
/c0de/_b00t_/up new $my_project_id 

```

\_b00t_ will create your project in /c0de/$my_project_id
In the future to upgrade \_b00t_ you can simply use GIT. 
```

```
# Or clone AiiA! 
AiiA is the tool being built in _b00t_, it's an NLP call center application. 
(http://elasticdotventures/aiia-callcenter)


#  When Finished:
you'll have a fully integrated development environment with secure language bindings to two languages, full permission provision, resources with budget-friendly serverless consumption models by default. 

# To cleanup:
**NOT FINISHED**
```
/c0de/_b00t_/ZZ-cleanup.sh $my_project_id
```

# Emojis & Chinese on the CLI
The author is a hardcore CLI guy too.  For some things using your mouse to copy-paste is better since it eliminates fat fingers. Let's keep it real - nobody except absolutely masochists would try to hand-type AZ Resource strings, so \_b00t_ strings are no different.  You will need to do some cutting and pasting, you probably won't like \_b00t_ if you're developing on a Digital VT100 .. 🙄 yeah, nah. 

## How to move around \_b00t_ on the CLI
You use the CLI? You're 1337! 0k4y. Hack your brain to use table complete & wildcard shortcuts. 

For directories with emojis or mixed case, use wildcards to hit targets. 
So `cd /c0*/` will chdir to `/c0de/`

Generally the targets use Emoji & HSK at the end, but as an exercise, here's a badly named directory: 
`/c0de/_b00t_/.../蓝色_Bicep_ARM_AzrResMgr.💪`

could be accessed from it's pwd using ANY of the following `cd` command. 
```
cd *Bicep*
cd *ARM*
cd *AzRes*
cd *💪
```
Technically this file is misnamed, should be ```Bicep_ARM_AzrResMgr.💙🤖💪```

On Windows, make sure you're using WSL2 on Unbuntu 20.04 with Windows Terminal Preview rather than the default shell and emoji works fine.  Putty and VS Terminal both work for outbound SSH and Sakura for inbound X-term/RDP.  If you're terminal doesn't support emoji, switch terminals.   If you're still using Vim you're missing intellisense in VS-Code and literally every single task is more difficult and error prone.  Tools like Azure ARM Bicep *assume* VS Code + intellisense for their transpiler also, so no VIM/Emacs support there.
