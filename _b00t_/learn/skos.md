SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)
What: A W3C standard for representing controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri, and classification schemes as RDF graphs.

Purpose: To model knowledge organization systems in a way that machines and humans can understand and share, especially on the Semantic Web.

Structure:

Concepts (nodes) with preferred labels (skos:prefLabel), alternate labels (skos:altLabel), and hidden labels.

Relations like broader (parent), narrower (child), and related for associative links.

Supports concept schemes (groupings of concepts).

Use Case:

Building and sharing taxonomies/thesauri (e.g., categorization of subjects, library classifications).

Linking vocabularies across systems.

Lightweight semantic web publishing.

Example: The Library of Congress Subject Headings or medical terminologies published as SKOS datasets.
