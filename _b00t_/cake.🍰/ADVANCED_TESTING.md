## Given-When-Then (GWT)
The Given is setting the stage, such as where everything’s at before the action
starts. Then you hit the When stage, the main event that gets things rolling. And
you wrap up with Then, where you spell out what you expect to happen after the dust settles. It’s like telling a story of what your code will carry out.

## Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)
This is similar to GWT. But GWT tends to be more narrative and user-centric,
making it ideal for collaboration among developers, testers, and nontechnical
stakeholders. AAA, on the other hand, is more about the technical execution of
the test itself.

## Setup-Exercise-Verify-Teardown (SEVT)
This is your go-to when you’re in the trenches of integration and systems testing.
You start with Setup, where you prep your testing ground. Then, you jump into
Exercise, where you run your system through its paces. After this, you go to Verify, which is where you play detective to confirm everything worked out. And
don’t forget the Teardown. This is the cleanup step that’s essential to keeping
everything neat for next time.
